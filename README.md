# OnChain-FedLearn
Federated learning, on-chain for collaborative + distributed training, private data, and enlightened inference in crypto fraud detection.

## The Main Elements
Privacy: Transaction data is held by the user/exchange, and not shared with the central database. Secured via Smart Contracts on-chain.
- Only training model and weights are exchanged
- Wallet addresses and transaction details remain private

Distributed Training: Training and fine-tuning occurs on the local nodes, 
- reducing central processing needs 
- reducing central storage needs
- reducing network bandwidth needs for transmission of data
- keeping transaction data private
- enabling real-time fraud detection

Enlighted Inference:
- Model benefits from the diversity of transaction patterns across exchanges
- Cross-chain fraud detection capabilities
- Real-time risk assessment
